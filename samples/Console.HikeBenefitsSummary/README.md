# Hiking Benefits Summary

This sample demonstrates how to use Gemini AI with a `gemini-1.5-pro` model, from a .NET 8.0 console application. Use the AI model to summarize a page of text to a few words. It consists of a console application, running locally, that will read the file `benefits.md` and send request to the Gemini API to summarize it.
